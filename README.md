Thanks! I checked your notebook here:
👉 [Hate\_Speech\_Detection\_using\_Deep\_Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/Ananyaa00051/Hate-speech-prediction/blob/main/Hate_Speech_Detection_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb)

Based on that, here’s a **simple and clear README** tailored to your project:

# Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify text as **hate speech**, **offensive language**, or **neither**. It is based on a publicly available dataset and implemented in Python using libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

## 📁 Project Contents

* `Hate_Speech_Detection_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all steps including data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
* `requirements.txt`: (optional – you can add this if you want to include dependencies)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is from [Kaggle - Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/hatred-classification-dataset) and contains labeled tweets with three categories:

* **Hate Speech**
* **Offensive Language**
* **Neither**

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `nltk`
* `sklearn`
* `tensorflow / keras`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ananyaa00051/Hate-speech-prediction.git
   cd Hate-speech-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook and run all cells:

   ```
   jupyter notebook Hate_Speech_Detection_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Summary

The model uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network for text classification after cleaning and tokenizing the text. It achieves a reasonable level of accuracy and F1 score in multi-class classification.
